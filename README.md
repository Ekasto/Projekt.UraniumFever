## Game Overview

### Disasters

Each disaster has a strength (1–4) and a direction (North, NorthEast, East, SouthEast, South, SouthWest, West, NorthWest).

At the start of a disaster, the player who drew it first rolls to determine the direction it comes from. Then they roll to determine its strength.

Tsunami:

Direction: 1 = North, 2 = East, 3 = South, 4 = West
Strength: 1 = travels 3 tiles
Strength: 2 = 6 tiles
Strength: 3 = 9 tiles
Strength: 4 = 12 tiles (entire board)

The tsunami moves forward one tile per round.

Setup:
the tsunami effects horizontally or vertically all tiles in a row at once

Effect:

All buildings and roads the tsunami hits are destroyed

If one of the headquarters is hit → Game Over

Thief:

Direction: has no direction (the thief always appears at the player who drew the card)
Strength: 1 = steals 2 resources chosen by the player
Strength: 2 = steals 4 resources
Strength: 3 = steals 6 resources
Strength: 4 = steals 8 resources

Don(k)zilla:

Direction: 1 = NorhtEast, 2 = SouthEast, 3 = SouthWest, 4 = NorthWest
Strength: 1 = 1 health
Strength: 2 = 2 health
Strength: 3 = 3 health
Strength: 4 = 4 health

Don(k)zilla moves each round toward the building closest to it.

Effect:

All buildings Don(k)zilla reaches are destroyed

If one of the headquarters is hit → Game Over
